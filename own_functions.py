#function = this executes the block of code only WHEN IT IS CALLED .....

#this is a very logical concept....see below example.

def weapon(knife):  #Here,weapon is a function that i have created.and knife inside the weapon brackets will acts as a variable like      
    print(knife)    #its acts an empty variable.so if we print knife it shows nothing coz its an empty variable. THE OWN CREATED 
weapon("axe") #FUCNTION ONLY EXECUTES WHEN ITS CALLED.So here axe acts as knife = axe ..knife is an empty variable so axe is beed added.  



#def hello(first_name , last_name):
 #   print("hii " + first_name + " " + last_name)

#hello('gokul','neeli')   #-->this is calling 




#def neeli():    #---> creaing own function
 #   print("gokul")
#neeli()  #--> this is calling
