#str.format() = its an optional method but it gives more control over the lines of code

#husband = "jack"
#wife = "isable"

#print ("{} and {} both are husband and wife".format(husband,wife))
#print ("{} and {} both are husband and wife".format("jack","isable"))
print ("{first} and {last} both are husband and wife".format(first = "jack",last = "isable")) #for this line variables not required
                                                                                                #coz variables are created in same line.



#we can also add some space before names....

#name = "gokul"
#print ("hello {:10} how are you ?".format(name))
#print ("hello {:<10} how are you ? ".format(name))
#print ("hello {:>10} how are you ? ".format(name))
#print ("hello {:^10} how are you ? ".format(name))
