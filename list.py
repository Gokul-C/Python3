#list = used to store multiple values in single variable...

#food = "gobi"  #this is normal variable it can only store single variable.

food = ["chicken","mutton","fish","eggs",]      #this is a list to create in single variable
#print (food)    #this can print with brackets and quotions.....so use for loop to print one by one 


#these are some useful functions of list...

#print(food.count("chicken"))
#food.reverse()
#food.clear()
#food.copy()
#food.append("gobi")
#print(food.index("eggs"))
#food.sort()

for n in food:
    print(n)

#print (food[0])  #this can only print chicken coz computers always starts with 0

#food [0] = "fish"  #this will swap chicken with fish
#print (food[0])
