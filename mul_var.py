#using multiple variables in single line of code....to decrease the program size.

name = "neeli" 

age = 22

girl = True

height = 1.3
  

print (name,age,girl,height)  


#these 5 lines of code can be done in 1 line of code to reduce time ....


name,age,girl,height = "neeli",22,True,1.3

print (name,age,girl,height)



#another example....


neeli = 22

gokul = 22 

chintha = 22

print (neeli)

print(gokul)

print (chintha)

#these 6 lines of code can be writen in 1 single line of code if it has same values... to do so.....

neeli = gokul = chintha = 22
print (neeli,gokul,chintha)
